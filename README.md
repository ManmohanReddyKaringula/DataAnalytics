## Hypothesis

1.   Coastal locations have higher wind speeds than inland locations
2.   Locations with a higher population have higher parts per million pollutants
3.   Coastal locations have higher precipitation than inland locations
4.   In coastal locations humidity levels and temperatures are correlated (directly proportional) as opposed to inland locations
5.   High altitude locations have more extreme temperatures (higher highs, lower lows) as opposed to low altitude locations
6.   Hurricanes dramatically increase precipitation in coastal locations
7.   Wind velocity and humidity in coastal locations are inversely proportional
8.   Tropical locations have higher longwave radiation than temperate locations
